User development requirements either in a markdown file or directly via CLI.
We have a novel-proposer persona agent to breakdown the requirements into uncommon development plans.
We have a critique persona agent to review the proposed plans, especially checking the feasibility.
The results are both fed to a 3rd party persona agent to summarize their consensus and conflicts to synthesize a final plan.
This plan is for user to approve/reject. Once approved, we create a Github Issue to track the plan implementation as per the open-issue skill.
